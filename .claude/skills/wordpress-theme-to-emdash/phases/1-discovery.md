# Phase 1: Discovery and reference capture

Gather the reference material needed for the requested page types and viewports. A live demo is useful but not required when the user provides source files, screenshots, or design assets.

## 1.0 Create Discovery Folder

Create a `discovery/` folder in your theme directory to store all reference materials:

```
discovery/
├── screenshots/          # Reference screenshots from demo site
│   ├── homepage.png
│   ├── single-post.png
│   ├── archive.png
│   ├── category.png
│   ├── page.png
│   └── 404.png
├── images/               # Sample images downloaded for seed content
│   ├── featured-1.jpg
│   ├── featured-2.jpg
│   └── hero.jpg
└── notes.md              # Design decisions and observations
```

The `notes.md` file should capture:

- Color values extracted from the demo
- Font families and sizes observed
- Layout patterns (header style, sidebar position, footer columns)
- Special components or interactions to recreate
- Anything that might be forgotten between sessions

## 1.1 Identify in-scope page types

Identify the URL of the demo site for the WordPress theme you are converting. For wordpress.org themes, this is usually wp-themes.com/theme-name/. For other themes, use the "Live Preview" link. This may show it inside a frame; if so, ignore the frame and focus on the theme's actual content.

Use agent-browser to explore the demo site and find the page types needed for the port:

- **Homepage** - Often has unique layout (hero, featured posts, etc.)
- **Blog/Archive** - Post listing page
- **Single Post** - Individual blog post with content
- **Page** - Static page (About, Contact, etc.)
- **Category/Tag Archive** - Taxonomy listing pages
- **Search Results** - If the theme has custom search styling
- **404 Page** - Error page styling

Use agent-browser to navigate the demo and discover pages:

```bash
agent-browser open https://demo-site.com
# Click around to find different page types
# Check the navigation menu for page links
# Look for "View all posts" or category links
```

## 1.2 Screenshot representative page types

Capture full-page screenshots of each page type to `discovery/screenshots/`:

```bash
# Homepage
agent-browser open https://demo-site.com
agent-browser screenshot discovery/screenshots/homepage.png --full

# Single post (find a post with featured image and good content)
agent-browser open https://demo-site.com/sample-post/
agent-browser screenshot discovery/screenshots/single-post.png --full

# Blog archive
agent-browser open https://demo-site.com/blog/
agent-browser screenshot discovery/screenshots/archive.png --full

# Category page
agent-browser open https://demo-site.com/category/news/
agent-browser screenshot discovery/screenshots/category.png --full

# Static page
agent-browser open https://demo-site.com/about/
agent-browser screenshot discovery/screenshots/page.png --full

# 404 page
agent-browser open https://demo-site.com/nonexistent-page-xyz/
agent-browser screenshot discovery/screenshots/404.png --full
```

## 1.3 Select sample images

The theme code's license does not establish the license of images shown on its demo. Reuse a demo image only when its license or the user's rights permit it. Otherwise use supplied assets or clearly licensed substitutes with similar dimensions and visual weight.

```bash
# Find featured images in demo posts
agent-browser eval "Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('article img')).map(i => i.src)"

# Download images for seed content
curl -o discovery/images/featured-1.jpg "https://demo-site.com/wp-content/uploads/photo1.jpg"
curl -o discovery/images/featured-2.jpg "https://demo-site.com/wp-content/uploads/photo2.jpg"
```

Record the source and license for every reused or substitute asset.

## 1.4 Document Page Structure

For each page type, document observations in `discovery/notes.md`:

- Header style (sticky? transparent? logo position?)
- Sidebar presence and position
- Footer layout (columns? widgets?)
- Special components (hero sections, CTAs, etc.)
- Color values (use browser DevTools color picker)
- Font families and sizes
- Spacing patterns

This inventory guides which templates and components you need to build, and preserves details that might be forgotten between sessions.

## Theme Source Discovery

### WordPress.org Themes

For themes on wordpress.org (e.g., `https://wordpress.org/themes/theme-name/`):

1. **Demo/Preview**: Click "Preview" button or visit `https://wp-themes.com/theme-name/`
2. **Source Download**: The "Download" button provides a ZIP, or use:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://downloads.wordpress.org/theme/theme-name.zip
   unzip theme-name.zip
   ```
3. **Theme Info**: The page includes author, version, tags, and description

### GitHub-Hosted Themes

1. **Source**: Clone or download the repository
2. **Demo**: Check README for demo URL, or look for `Demo:` in theme description
3. **Documentation**: Usually in README or `/docs` folder

### ThemeForest / Premium Themes

1. **Demo**: Use the "Live Preview" button on the product page
2. **Source**: Requires purchase - ask the user to provide the unzipped theme files
3. **Documentation**: Usually included in the download or linked from the product page

### Source discovery

When given only a theme URL or name, inspect the public listing for source and demo links. Ask the user for files that require a purchase or authentication.

1. Fetch the listing page to extract demo URL, download URL, and theme info
2. Download the source (if freely available)
3. Open an accessible demo in agent-browser.
